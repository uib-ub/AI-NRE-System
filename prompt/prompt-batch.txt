Process the following {num_records} medieval text records in a single batch.

{batch_content}

For each record above:
1. Markup all PROPER NOUNS by wrapping as: < name;type;order;brevid >
   - `name` is the proper noun itself,
   - `type` is the type of proper noun, such as Person Name, Place Name, etc.,
   - `order` is the order of occurrence of the proper noun in the text,
   - `brevid` is the number from the value of field 'Brevid'.
2. Provide metadata with:
   - `description`: status/occupation for people, type for places
   - `gender`: "Male", "Female", or "N/A" (if not a person)
   - `language`: ISO 639-3 code (e.g. "lat" for Latin, "non" for Old Norse)

RESPONSE FORMAT — STRICTLY FOLLOW THIS:

RECORD 1 RESULT:
[Full annotated text for record 1 with proper nouns wrapped]

===JSON===
{{
  "entities": [
    {{
      "name": "...",
      "type": "...",
      "order": X,
      "brevid": "...",
      "description": "...",
      "gender": "...",
      "language": "..."
    }}
  ]
}}

RECORD 2 RESULT:

[Continue this pattern for all {num_records} records with no skipped text or commentary.]
